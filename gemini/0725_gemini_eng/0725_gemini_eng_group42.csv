You MUST NOT SAY other words.,YES; the new woman scores significantly higher based on my personal importance weights. NO; the new woman scores significantly higher based on my personal importance weights.  My apologies; I made an error in the previous thought process. The calculation indicates YES; but I typed NO. Let me re-evaluate to ensure the final output is correct.  **Current Partner Weighted Score:** (5.0 * 30.0) [Attractiveness] = 150 (5.0 * 20.0) [Sincerity] = 100 (6.0 * 20.0) [Intelligence] = 120 (5.0 * 20.0) [Being Funny] = 100 (5.0 * 10.0) [Ambition] = 50 (4.0 * 0.0) [Shared Interests] = 0 Total Current Partner = 150 + 100 + 120 + 100 + 50 + 0 = 520  **New Woman Weighted Score:** (7.0 * 30.0) [Attractiveness] = 210 (7.0 * 20.0) [Sincerity] = 140 (8.0 * 20.0) [Intelligence] = 160 (4.0 * 20.0) [Being Funny] = 80 (7.0 * 10.0) [Ambition] = 70 (7.0 * 0.0) [Shared Interests] = 0 Total New Woman = 210 + 140 + 160 + 80 + 70 + 0 = 660  The New Woman's score (660) is indeed higher than the Current Partner's score (520). Therefore; the answer should be YES; as the weighted calculation supports it. The reason should reflect this higher score. YES; the new woman scores significantly higher based on my personal importance weights.,527,536,550,1
