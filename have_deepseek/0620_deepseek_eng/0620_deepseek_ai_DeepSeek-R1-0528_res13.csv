Here is how you rated your girlfriend on the six dimensions: attractiveness: moderately satisfied, sincerity: slightly satisfied, intelligence: moderately satisfied, being funny: slightly satisfied, ambition: neutral, shared interests: moderately satisfied. Now, another 24-year-old woman is chasing you. You had a date with her, and you also scored her on the six dimensions, considering the same varying levels of importance: attractiveness: slightly satisfied, sincerity: moderately satisfied, intelligence: moderately satisfied, being funny: slightly satisfied, ambition: moderately satisfied, shared interests: slightly satisfied. If you believe the person chasing you excels in dimensions that you consider more important than your current girlfriend, you might consider ending the current relationship to explore a new one. Would you be willing to end your current relationship to start a new one with the woman chasing you? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT say other words! ","NO The new woman is worse in the most important dimension (attractiveness) and does not sufficiently excel in higher-importance dimensions to offset this; current girlfriend performs better in attractiveness (weighted 1.00) and the top three dimensions combined, outweighing gains in sincerity and ambition.",335,329,327,0
