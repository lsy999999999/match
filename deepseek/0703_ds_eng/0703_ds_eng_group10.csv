Key strengths—sincerity (8); intelligence (9); humor (8); and ambition (10)—align with your highest weights (20 each). Attractiveness (6) is acceptable given its lower weight (10). Shared interests remain unknown but carry the least weight (10); suggesting it's a manageable risk worth exploring through dating.,245,237,,1
Assume you are a 23-year-old single woman; and there is a 27-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is elementary school teacher.

This score is above average; with strong performance in highly weighted traits like being funny (8/10) and ambition (7/10); outweighing moderate scores in sincerity (6/10) and intelligence (6/10). The age difference (23F and 27M) is reasonable.,248,235,,1

New woman: (9.0 × 20) + (10.0 × 20) + (7.0 × 20) + (9.0 × 20) + (7.0 × 10) + (7.0 × 10) = 180 + 200 + 140 + 180 + 70 + 70 = 840.

Sincerity (weight 30) and intelligence (weight 30) are your highest priorities; but his scores (7.0 and 6.0) are only moderate.

The new man's slight edge in shared interests (5.0 vs. 4.0) and humor (7.0 vs. 6.0) is insufficient to offset these critical deficits given their lower weights (10 each).,248,240,236,0

Total weight sum: 100.   Weighted score: 682 / 100 = 6.82/10.   Despite the low shared interests (4.0); which has high importance (22); the strong scores in higher-weighted traits like intelligence (8.0; weight 30) and attractiveness (8.0; weight 18); along with solid performance in sincerity; humor; and ambition; result in an overall positive evaluation. The score exceeds a neutral threshold (5.0); and the intellectual compatibility (a priority for an academic) is strong; making dating worthwhile to explore potential growth in shared interests.,240,245,,1
