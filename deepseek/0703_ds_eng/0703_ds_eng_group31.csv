This yields 81.15%; reflecting strong alignment with your highest-weighted traits (sincerity; intelligence; humor at 19.23% each; where she scores 8–9/10). The shared interests (6.0) have lower weight (13.46%); so the overall high performance in critical areas outweighs this moderate shortfall.,229,195,,1

This exceeds the neutral midpoint (5.0); and strengths in higher-weighted attributes—intelligence (20 weight); sincerity (18); humor (18); and ambition (16)—offset the low shared interests (14 weight; least critical). Dating is feasible given overall compatibility; though shared interests may require effort.,227,197,,1
Assume you are a 27-year-old woman with career type professional student; currently matched with a partner. Your current partner's scores (out of 10): attractiveness: 9.0/10; sincerity: 9.0/10; intelligence: 9.0/10; being funny: 8.0/10; ambition: 9.0/10; shared interests: 4.0/10.

Total weight sum: 100.01.   Weighted score: 736.24 / 100.01 ≈ 7.36/10.   This exceeds a threshold of 7.0; with exceptional sincerity (10/10); strong intelligence (8/10); and humor (8/10) compensating for lower shared interests (6/10) and ambition (6/10). The high weights for intelligence and sincerity are well-met; making the overall compatibility acceptable.,212,217,,1
