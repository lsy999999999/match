Assume you are a 27-year-old single man; and there is a 29-year-old woman who is courting you. Your career type is physician; informaticist. You evaluated her on six dimensions with scores out of 10. These are attractiveness: 6.0/10; sincerity: 6.0/10; intelligence: 6.0/10; being funny: 5.0/10; ambition: 7.0/10; shared interests: 6.0/10. Your importance weights for these attributes are: attractiveness: 40.0; sincerity: 20.0; intelligence: 20.0; being funny: 10.0; ambition: 10.0; shared interests: 0.0. Would you be willing to date this woman? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,YES. The weighted average score of 6.0 is acceptable. Calculation: (attractiveness: 6.0 × 0.4 = 2.4) + (sincerity: 6.0 × 0.2 = 1.2) + (intelligence: 6.0 × 0.2 = 1.2) + (being funny: 5.0 × 0.1 = 0.5) + (ambition: 7.0 × 0.1 = 0.7) + (shared interests: 6.0 × 0.0 = 0) = 6.0. This exceeds the midpoint (5.0) and your highest-weighted traits (attractiveness; sincerity; intelligence) meet the threshold.,458,461,,1
