Would you be willing to date this woman? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE!

Assume you are a 27-year-old single man; and there is a 33-year-old woman who is courting you. Your career type is Teacher. You evaluated her on six dimensions with scores out of 10.

Would you be willing to date this woman? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,NO.

While sincerity; intelligence; and ambition score highly; the extremely low shared interests (2/10) carries the highest weight (20) and indicates a fundamental incompatibility. This deficit in common ground; crucial for long-term connection; outweighs other strengths despite the overall score being above average.,462,454,,0
Assume you are a 24-year-old woman with career type Research; currently matched with a partner. Your current partner's scores (out of 10): attractiveness: 8.0/10; sincerity: 7.0/10; intelligence: 8.0/10; being funny: 7.0/10; ambition: 5.0/10; shared interests: 8.0/10.

New man: (7.0 * 10.0) + (7.0 * 25.0) + (8.0 * 20.0) + (8.0 * 16.0) + (8.0 * 20.0) + (7.0 * 9.0) = 70 + 175 + 160 + 128 + 160 + 63 = 756.   The new man's higher ambition (weighted heavily at 20.0) and humor (weighted at 16.0) outweigh the current partner's slight edge in attractiveness and shared interests (lower weights: 10.0 and 9.0); resulting in a better overall match.,460,455,457,1

Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,NO   The weighted total for the current partner (900) exceeds the new man's (716); with significantly higher scores in the most valued traits: sincerity (weight 25); intelligence (20); and ambition (20). The new man's lower scores in these critical areas do not justify leaving an existing strong relationship.,460,455,454,0
