Assume you are a 29-year-old single woman; and there is a 28-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is comedienne. You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10. These are attractiveness: 9.0/10; sincerity: 9.0/10; intelligence: 10.0/10; being funny: 9.0/10; ambition: nan/10; shared interests: 4.0/10. Your importance weights for these attributes are: attractiveness: 5.0; sincerity: 20.0; intelligence: 25.0; being funny: 15.0; ambition: 15.0; shared interests: 20.0. Would you be willing to date this man? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,NO. The shared interests score is critically low (4.0/10) with a high importance weight (20.0); indicating a significant mismatch in common activities or values; which could hinder long-term compatibility. Additionally; the ambition score is missing (weighted 15.0); introducing uncertainty about his drive and future goals. While he excels in sincerity; intelligence; humor; and attractiveness; the combination of weak shared interests and unknown ambition outweighs these strengths for a sustainable relationship.,69,60,,0
Assume you are a 26-year-old single woman; and there is a 22-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is attorney. You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10. These are attractiveness: 8.0/10; sincerity: 9.0/10; intelligence: 9.0/10; being funny: 9.0/10; ambition: 8.0/10; shared interests: 8.0/10. Your importance weights for these attributes are: attractiveness: 30.0; sincerity: 10.0; intelligence: 20.0; being funny: 20.0; ambition: 10.0; shared interests: 10.0. Would you be willing to date this man? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,YES. The calculated weighted average score is 8.5/10; which is high and aligns well with your priorities. Attractiveness (30% weight; scored 8.0); intelligence (20% weight; scored 9.0); and humor (20% weight; scored 9.0) are your most valued traits; and he excels in these areas. Sincerity; ambition; and shared interests also scored strongly (9.0; 8.0; 8.0 respectively) with moderate weights. The overall compatibility outweighs the age difference; given his maturity reflected in high ambition and intelligence scores.,67,62,,1
Assume you are a 28-year-old single woman; and there is a 26-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is Academic. You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10. These are attractiveness: 6.0/10; sincerity: 5.0/10; intelligence: 6.0/10; being funny: 8.0/10; ambition: 8.0/10; shared interests: 4.0/10. Your importance weights for these attributes are: attractiveness: 15.0; sincerity: 15.0; intelligence: 20.0; being funny: 15.0; ambition: 15.0; shared interests: 20.0. Would you be willing to date this man? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,NO. The weighted score calculation (attractiveness: 6.0×15 = 90; sincerity: 5.0×15 = 75; intelligence: 6.0×20 = 120; being funny: 8.0×15 = 120; ambition: 8.0×15 = 120; shared interests: 4.0×20 = 80) totals 605/1000. While ambition and humor are strengths; the low score in shared interests (4.0) and average intelligence (6.0) are critical given their high importance weights (20% each). As an academic; shared intellectual pursuits and common interests are essential for long-term compatibility; and the 4.0 rating indicates insufficient alignment in these areas. The sincerity score (5.0) is also borderline; further reducing confidence in a meaningful connection.,70,61,,0
Assume you are a 27-year-old single woman; and there is a 26-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is social worker. You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10.

Your importance weights for these attributes are: attractiveness: 10.0; sincerity: 25.0; intelligence: 25.0; being funny: 10.0; ambition: 10.0; shared interests: 20.0. Would you be willing to date this man? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,YES   The weighted average score is 6.2/10; calculated as follows:   (5.0×10 + 6.0×25 + 8.0×25 + 6.0×10 + 8.0×10 + 4.0×20) / (10+25+25+10+10+20) = 620/100 = 6.2.   This exceeds a neutral threshold (5.0); with strengths in intelligence (8.0; weight 25) and ambition (8.0; weight 10) compensating for lower shared interests (4.0; weight 20). Sincerity (6.0; weight 25) is adequate; and the shared interests gap may be navigable through communication and exploration.,70,64,,1
Assume you are a 21-year-old single man; and there is a 23-year-old woman who is courting you. Your career type is Pro Beach Volleyball. You evaluated her on six dimensions with scores out of 10.

This exceeds a typical threshold for dating; as high weights on attractiveness (60%); sincerity (15%); and humor (15%)—where she scored well (8.0; 8.0; 9.0)—outweigh the lower shared interests score (6.0; weighted 10%). Intelligence and ambition have 0% weight; so their high scores do not impact the decision.,65,71,,1

The overall evaluation meets a favorable threshold given the emphasis on ambition.,56,66,,1

Your highest-weighted traits (sincerity; intelligence; ambition) are perfect (10/10); and humor (critical for a comedienne) is strong (9/10). Shared interests (8/10) is the only moderate score; but the overall alignment with your priorities is exceptional. The age gap (4 years) is not a weighted factor and thus doesn't negatively impact the evaluation.,74,60,,1

You MUST NOT SAY other words.,NO The weighted average is 4.9/10; calculated as follows: (4.0×10 + 5.0×25 + 7.0×25 + 4.0×10 + 5.0×10 + 3.0×20) / (10+25+25+10+10+20) = 490/100 = 4.9. This falls below a passing threshold; especially given the low score (3/10) in shared interests; which carries high importance (weight 20). As a social worker; shared values and interests are crucial for relational compatibility; and the lackluster scores in sincerity (5/10) and ambition (5/10) further diminish potential. The strengths in intelligence (7/10) do not sufficiently offset these deficits.,68,64,,0
