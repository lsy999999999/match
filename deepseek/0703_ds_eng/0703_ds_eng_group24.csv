Assume you are a 21-year-old single man; and there is a 30-year-old woman who is courting you. Your career type is Banking. You evaluated her on six dimensions with scores out of 10. These are attractiveness: 3.0/10; sincerity: 3.0/10; intelligence: 5.0/10; being funny: 3.0/10; ambition: 5.0/10; shared interests: 3.0/10.

Other traits like humor and ambition also scored modestly (3.0–5.0) with moderate weights. Overall; the combination of low scores in prioritized areas and minimal shared interests (5% weight; scored 3.0) suggests insufficient compatibility.,47,34,,0
Assume you are a 30-year-old single woman; and there is a 23-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is law. You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10.

Would you be willing to date this man? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,YES   The weighted score calculation yields 9.0/9.0 (excluding ambition and shared interests due to 0% weight and missing data). Attractiveness (30% weight) and humor (30% weight) are perfect (10/10); sincerity (20% weight) is perfect (10/10); and intelligence (10% weight) is perfect (10/10).

This exceeds a threshold of 6.5 for compatibility; with high sincerity (8/10; weight 20) and ambition (9/10; weight 15) compensating for average attractiveness (5/10; weight 20). As a social worker; her strong sincerity and ambition align with values of empathy and dedication; making her a promising match despite moderate shared interests and humor.,54,25,,1

The current partner scores higher in attractiveness (weighted 20) and shared interests (weighted 15); which are prioritized; and matches ambition and intelligence.

Key high-weight categories (attractiveness; sincerity; intelligence; shared interests at 20% each) favor the current partner: intelligence (9 vs 7); shared interests (8 vs 5); and attractiveness (6 vs 5); with equal sincerity.

Despite high scores in sincerity (8.0); intelligence (8.0); and ambition (9.0); the extremely low shared interests (3.0) carries the highest weight (18) and indicates fundamental incompatibility. Low attractiveness (5.0) and humor (4.0) further reduce appeal. These deficits in highly weighted areas outweigh strengths; suggesting poor long-term compatibility.,43,21,,0

The higher weightings for sincerity; intelligence; humor; and ambition (20 each) favor the new man's strong scores in sincerity (9); intelligence (8); and ambition (9); outweighing the current partner's strengths in sincerity (10) and intelligence (9) but weaknesses in attractiveness (3) and missing shared interests.,41,30,39,1
