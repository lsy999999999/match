Assume you are a 36-year-old single man; and there is a 29-year-old woman who is courting you. Your career type is Educator. You evaluated her on six dimensions with scores out of 10.

Total = 835 ÷ 100 (sum of weights) = 8.35.   She excels in highly weighted traits like sincerity (10); humor (10); and intelligence (9); outweighing the moderate scores in ambition (7) and shared interests (6). The age gap (36M/29F) is reasonable; and her strengths align with values an educator might prioritize.,334,326,,1

Attractiveness (weighted 40%) and shared interests (5%) are critically low (1/10); outweighing strengths like intelligence and ambition. As a school psychologist; emotional and relational compatibility is prioritized; and the lack of physical attraction and common ground makes a sustainable romantic connection unlikely.,335,324,,0
Assume you are a 36-year-old woman with career type Educator; currently matched with a partner. Your current partner's scores (out of 10): attractiveness: 7.0/10; sincerity: 6.0/10; intelligence: 7.0/10; being funny: 8.0/10; ambition: 6.0/10; shared interests: 5.0/10.

New man = (8.0.15) + (10.0.15) + (9.0.15) + (10.0.20) + (7.0.20) + (6.0.15) = 120 + 150 + 135 + 200 + 140 + 90 = 835.   New man's total (835) exceeds current partner's (655); with higher scores in key weighted traits like sincerity (15); intelligence (15); being funny (20); and ambition (20).,334,326,325,1

New man = (6.0*22) + (8.0*12) + (8.0*30) + (10.0*25) + (8.0*10) + (6.0*1) = 132 + 96 + 240 + 250 + 80 + 6 = 804.   New man's total (804) exceeds current partner's (643); with higher scores in top-weighted traits (intelligence 30; humor 25; attractiveness 22).,332,328,324,1
Assume you are a 30-year-old single man; and there is a 27-year-old woman who is courting you. Your career type is School Psychologist. You evaluated her on six dimensions with scores out of 10.

Your importance weights for these attributes are: attractiveness: 10.0; sincerity: 20.0; intelligence: 20.0; being funny: 10.0; ambition: 10.0; shared interests: 30.0. Would you be willing to date this woman? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE!

This falls below a reasonable threshold for compatibility; especially given low scores in the highest-weighted traits: shared interests (30% weight; scored 5.0) and sincerity (20% weight; scored 5.0). As a school psychologist prioritizing emotional connection and common values; these deficits outweigh strengths in intelligence and ambition.,338,325,,0
Assume you are a 23-year-old single woman; and there is a 22-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is Investment Banking. You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10.

This exceeds a passing threshold (e.g.; 7.0); with exceptional performance in your highest-weighted traits: attractiveness (50% weight; score 9.0) and humor (20% weight; score 9.0). Lower ambition (6.0) is mitigated by its lower weight (10%); and shared interests (0% weight) are irrelevant.,330,333,,1
Assume you are a 24-year-old single woman; and there is a 23-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is research. You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10.

The ambition score is missing (nan) and it holding a weight of 15.0; which is significant. As a research-oriented individual; ambition is a key factor for compatibility and long-term alignment. Without this critical data point; the overall evaluation is incomplete and risky. The calculated weighted average of the available attributes (≈6.76) is moderate; but the unknown ambition could drastically lower the score (e.g.; to 5.75 if scored 0) and impact relationship dynamics. Proceeding without this information is not advisable.,324,335,,0

Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,YES The new man's weighted total score (804) significantly exceeds the current partner's (611) based on your priority weights; especially excelling in intelligence (weight 30) and humor (weight 25); which are your highest priorities. The current partner's missing shared interest score (treated as 0) has minimal impact due to low weight (1).,332,328,329,1

You MUST NOT SAY other words.,NO The current partner has a higher score in high-weight attributes: sincerity (8.0 vs 9.0; but weight 25.0); being funny (10.0 vs 8.0; weight 20.0); and shared interests (10.0 vs 7.0; weight 15.0). The new man excels in ambition (9.0; weight 10.0) and slightly in intelligence and sincerity; but these gains are offset by the current partner's strengths in more heavily prioritized areas. The missing ambition score for the current partner is a risk; but given the high scores elsewhere; it is reasonable to assume it is at least adequate. The weighted sum for known attributes favors the current partner (790 vs 745 without ambition); and even with the new man's full score (835); the current partner's potential total (with ambition ≥5.0) likely remains competitive or superior.,333,330,327,0

Score: 730/100 = 7.3/10. This exceeds a neutral threshold; with high scores in the most valued traits—sincerity (20 weight; 8.0); intelligence (20 weight; 8.0); and shared interests (30 weight; 7.0)—making her a compatible match despite average attractiveness (6.0).,337,325,,1
