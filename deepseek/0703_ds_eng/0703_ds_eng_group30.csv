Assume you are a 27-year-old single woman; and there is a 22-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is Child Rights. You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10. These are attractiveness: 5.0/10; sincerity: 6.0/10; intelligence: 6.0/10; being funny: 5.0/10; ambition: 9.0/10; shared interests: 5.0/10. Your importance weights for these attributes are: attractiveness: 16.98; sincerity: 16.98; intelligence: 16.98; being funny: 16.98; ambition: 16.98; shared interests: 15.09. Would you be willing to date this man? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,NO. The weighted average score is 60.18%; which is below a strong match threshold. Ambition (9.0) is high; but other critical factors like shared interests (5.0); attractiveness (5.0); and humor (5.0) are mediocre; and sincerity/intelligence (6.0) are only slightly above average. The 5-year age gap (27F/22M) may indicate differing life stages and maturity levels; compounded by low shared interests—a concern for someone in Child Rights work. The overall profile lacks sufficient alignment for a confident yes.,177,189,,1
Assume you are a 25-year-old single woman; and there is a 29-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is Development work on field in the middle of nowhere. You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10. These are attractiveness: 5.0/10; sincerity: 8.0/10; intelligence: 8.0/10; being funny: 8.0/10; ambition: 4.0/10; shared interests: nan/10. Your importance weights for these attributes are: attractiveness: 15.56; sincerity: 20.0; intelligence: 20.0; being funny: 20.0; ambition: 13.33; shared interests: 11.11. Would you be willing to date this man? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,YES. The suitor excels in the top-weighted attributes—sincerity (8/10; weight 20.0); intelligence (8/10; weight 20.0); and humor (8/10; weight 20.0)—which collectively dominate the evaluation. Despite lower scores in ambition (4/10) and attractiveness (5/10); their lower weights (13.33 and 15.56) minimize their impact. The missing shared interests score (weight 11.11; the least important) does not outweigh the strong performance in critical areas. The calculated weighted average of known attributes is approximately 6.875/10; which is above average; supporting a positive decision.,174,190,,1
