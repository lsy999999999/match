Assume you are a 22-year-old single woman; and there is a 25-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is Speech Language Pathologist.

Your importance weights for these attributes are: attractiveness: 17.0; sincerity: 10.0; intelligence: 18.0; being funny: 20.0; ambition: 25.0; shared interests: 10.0. Would you be willing to date this man? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,NO. The calculated weighted average score is approximately 5.24/10; reflecting poor alignment with high-priority attributes: very low attractiveness (2/10 at 17% weight) and mediocre ambition (6/10 at 25% weight); with shared interests unknown despite 10% weight importance.,40,27,,0
Assume you are a 22-year-old single woman; and there is a 25-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is Social Work Administration. You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10. These are attractiveness: 4.0/10; sincerity: 9.0/10; intelligence: 4.0/10; being funny: 4.0/10; ambition: 5.0/10; shared interests: nan/10.

Would you be willing to date this man? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,NO The weighted average of the evaluated attributes (excluding shared interests) is approximately 5.39/10; which is below a satisfactory threshold. While sincerity is exceptionally high (9.0) and heavily weighted (22%); the low scores in attractiveness (4.0); intelligence (4.0); humor (4.0); and ambition (5.0)—coupled with their moderate to high importance weights—outweigh this strength. The missing shared interests score adds uncertainty; but the current deficits in key areas suggest insufficient compatibility for dating.,40,29,,0
Assume you are a 22-year-old single woman; and there is a 30-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is Social Work Administration. You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10. These are attractiveness: 5.0/10; sincerity: 6.0/10; intelligence: 6.0/10; being funny: 7.0/10; ambition: 6.0/10; shared interests: nan/10. Your importance weights for these attributes are: attractiveness: 20.0; sincerity: 22.0; intelligence: 18.0; being funny: 15.0; ambition: 15.0; shared interests: 10.0. Would you be willing to date this man? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,NO. The weighted average score of the evaluated attributes (excluding shared interests due to missing data) is approximately 5.94/10; calculated as follows:   - Adjusted weights (total 90): Attractiveness (20/90 ≈ 0.222); Sincerity (22/90 ≈ 0.244); Intelligence (18/90 = 0.2); Being Funny (15/90 ≈ 0.167); Ambition (15/90 ≈ 0.167).   - Calculation: (5.0 × 0.222) + (6.0 × 0.244) + (6.0 × 0.2) + (7.0 × 0.167) + (6.0 × 0.167) ≈ 1.11 + 1.464 + 1.2 + 1.169 + 1.002 = 5.945.   This score is below a reasonable threshold (e.g.; 6.0) for pursuing a relationship. Key factors like Attractiveness (5.0) and Sincerity (6.0) are mediocre; and the absence of shared interests data (weighted 10.0) introduces uncertainty about long-term alignment. The overall profile does not meet sufficient standards for dating.,47,29,,0
Assume you are a 30-year-old single man; and there is a 30-year-old woman who is courting you. Your career type is law. You evaluated her on six dimensions with scores out of 10.

Would you be willing to date this woman? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,YES. The non-missing attributes (attractiveness; sincerity; intelligence; being funny) are perfect and account for 90% of the total weight. Even if shared interests scores 0 (worst case); the overall weighted score would be 9.0/10; which is very high. Ambition has 0 weight; so its score is irrelevant.,33,41,,1

Assume you are a 26-year-old single woman; and there is a 25-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is Biostatistics. You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10.

Would you be willing to date this man? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,YES. The weighted average score is calculated as follows:   Attractiveness: (4.0/10) * 20.0 = 8.0   Sincerity: (5.0/10) * 25.0 = 12.5   Intelligence: (8.0/10) * 20.0 = 16.0   Being Funny: (8.0/10) * 15.0 = 12.0   Ambition: (10.0/10) * 15.0 = 15.0   Shared Interests: (8.0/10) * 5.0 = 4.0   Total: 8.0 + 12.5 + 16.0 + 12.0 + 15.0 + 4.0 = 67.5/100.    Despite low attractiveness (4.0) and sincerity (5.0); the suitor excels in intelligence (8.0); humor (8.0); ambition (10.0); and shared interests (8.0). Ambition and intelligence align well with a biostatistics career; and the overall score (67.5) is sufficient for a first date; given his strengths in highly weighted areas like intelligence (20.0 weight) and ambition (15.0 weight).,49,36,,1

This high score (86%) aligns with your priorities; while the lower scores in ambition and shared interests carry zero weight and thus do not affect your decision.,25,54,,1

You MUST NOT SAY other words.,YES The overall weighted score is 7.0; which is acceptable. The candidate excels in intelligence (8.0) and ambition (9.0); both highly weighted factors (30.0 and 10.0 respectively). However; the being funny score (6.0) is below average and carries the second-highest weight (25.0); which is a concern. Sincerity (6.0) and shared interests (6.0) are average but weighted moderately (10.0 and 15.0). Attractiveness (7.0) is solid. Despite the weakness in humor; the total score meets the threshold for consideration; and the age difference (27 vs. 24) is minimal.,44,37,,1

The new woman scores higher in attractiveness (8.0 vs. 5.0); intelligence (9.0 vs. 8.0); sincerity (10.0 vs. 8.0); and humor (9.0 vs. 6.0); which are the most heavily weighted traits.

Shared interests (weight 10) cannot bridge this gap; as the new man's 5/10 there adds only 50 points; insufficient to surpass the current partner's lead.,41,30,33,0

For the new woman: (6.0×15) + (6.0×20) + (8.0×15) + (6.0×30) + (7.0×5) + (6.0×15) = 90 + 120 + 120 + 180 + 35 + 90 = 635.
