The current partner's weighted total is 770.65; calculated as follows:   - Attractiveness: 5.0 * 9.76 = 48.8   - Sincerity: 10.0 * 19.51 = 195.1   - Intelligence: 8.0 * 19.51 = 156.08   - Being Funny: 5.0 * 14.63 = 73.15   - Ambition: 10.0 * 19.51 = 195.1   - Shared Interests: 6.0 * 17.07 = 102.42   Sum: 48.8 + 195.1 + 156.08 + 73.15 + 195.1 + 102.42 = 770.65.    The new man's ambition is unknown (nan); making a fair comparison impossible. Even if ambition is optimistically assumed at 10.0 (maximum); his weighted total is 741.39:   - Attractiveness: 7.0 * 9.76 = 68.32   - Sincerity: 7.0 * 19.51 = 136.57   - Intelligence: 7.0 * 19.51 = 136.57   - Being Funny: 7.0 * 14.63 = 102.41   - Ambition: 10.0 * 19.51 = 195.1 (assumed)   - Shared Interests: 6.0 * 17.07 = 102.42   Sum: 68.32 + 136.57 + 136.57 + 102.41 + 195.1 + 102.42 = 741.39.    This is still lower than the current partner's 770.65. Given the high importance weights for sincerity (19.51); intelligence (19.51); and ambition (19.51); the current partner's strengths in these areas (10.0; 8.0; 10.0) outweigh the new man's moderate scores (7.0; 7.0; unknown) and slightly higher attractiveness (7.0 vs. 5.0). The uncertainty around the new man's ambition and his lower total score make switching inadvisable.,161,153,143,0
