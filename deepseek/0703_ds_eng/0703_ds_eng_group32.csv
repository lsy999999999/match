Assume you are a 27-year-old single woman; and there is a 26-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is Professor. You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10. These are attractiveness: 7.0/10; sincerity: 7.0/10; intelligence: 7.0/10; being funny: 9.0/10; ambition: 9.0/10; shared interests: nan/10. Your importance weights for these attributes are: attractiveness: 20.0; sincerity: 20.0; intelligence: 20.0; being funny: 25.0; ambition: 5.0; shared interests: 10.0. Would you be willing to date this man? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,YES. The weighted average of the provided attributes (attractiveness; sincerity; intelligence; being funny; ambition) is calculated as follows:   (7.0 × 20) + (7.0 × 20) + (7.0 × 20) + (9.0 × 25) + (9.0 × 5) = 140 + 140 + 140 + 225 + 45 = 690.   This sum covers 90% of the total weight (20+20+20+25+5=90). The partial score is 690 / 90 ≈ 7.67.   Even if shared interests (10% weight) scores 0 (worst case); the total score would be (690 + 0) / 100 = 6.9; which is still acceptable. The high scores in humor (9.0; 25% weight) and ambition (9.0) are strong positives; and the other attributes meet baseline expectations (7.0). The missing shared interests introduce uncertainty but do not outweigh the overall promising profile.,240,243,,1
Assume you are a 25-year-old single woman; and there is a 27-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is professor; poet/critic. You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10. These are attractiveness: 8.0/10; sincerity: 8.0/10; intelligence: 8.0/10; being funny: 9.0/10; ambition: 7.0/10; shared interests: 8.0/10. Your importance weights for these attributes are: attractiveness: 20.0; sincerity: 20.0; intelligence: 20.0; being funny: 20.0; ambition: 10.0; shared interests: 10.0. Would you be willing to date this man? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,YES The weighted average score is 8.1/10; with high marks in your top-priority traits: attractiveness (8.0); sincerity (8.0); intelligence (8.0); and humor (9.0); each weighted at 20%. Ambition (7.0; weight 10%) and shared interests (8.0; weight 10%) are solid but less critical to you. This balance aligns well with your values as a professor and poet/critic; making him a promising match.,238,250,,1
Assume you are a 28-year-old single woman; and there is a 24-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is Management Consultant. You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10. These are attractiveness: 4.0/10; sincerity: 6.0/10; intelligence: 7.0/10; being funny: 2.0/10; ambition: 2.0/10; shared interests: 1.0/10. Your importance weights for these attributes are: attractiveness: 20.0; sincerity: 20.0; intelligence: 20.0; being funny: 10.0; ambition: 10.0; shared interests: 20.0. Would you be willing to date this man? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,NO. The weighted average score is 4.0/10; calculated as follows:   Attractiveness (4.0 × 20) = 80   Sincerity (6.0 × 20) = 120   Intelligence (7.0 × 20) = 140   Being funny (2.0 × 10) = 20   Ambition (2.0 × 10) = 20   Shared interests (1.0 × 20) = 20   Total = 400 ÷ 100 (total weight) = 4.0.   Key high-weight attributes like shared interests (1.0); attractiveness (4.0); and ambition (2.0) are critically low; outweighing moderate scores in sincerity and intelligence. As a career-driven management consultant; misalignment in ambition and shared interests suggests incompatibility.,236,244,,0
Assume you are a 23-year-old single man; and there is a 33-year-old woman who is courting you. Your career type is elementary school teacher. You evaluated her on six dimensions with scores out of 10. These are attractiveness: 5.0/10; sincerity: 9.0/10; intelligence: 8.0/10; being funny: 7.0/10; ambition: 8.0/10; shared interests: 5.0/10. Your importance weights for these attributes are: attractiveness: 15.0; sincerity: 15.0; intelligence: 20.0; being funny: 20.0; ambition: 20.0; shared interests: 10.0. Would you be willing to date this woman? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,YES. The weighted average score is 7.2/10; calculated as follows:   (5.0×15 + 9.0×15 + 8.0×20 + 7.0×20 + 8.0×20 + 5.0×10) / (15+15+20+20+20+10) = 720/100 = 7.2.   This exceeds a neutral threshold (5.0); with high weights (20) on intelligence; humor; and ambition—where she scored well (8;7;8)—offsetting lower attractiveness (5) and shared interests (5). Sincerity (9) is also strong. The age gap (10 years) is not factored into the evaluation per the provided attributes.,251,235,,1
Assume you are a 26-year-old woman with career type Entertainment/Media; currently matched with a partner. Your current partner's scores (out of 10): attractiveness: 6.0/10; sincerity: 7.0/10; intelligence: 8.0/10; being funny: 6.0/10; ambition: 7.0/10; shared interests: 5.0/10.

Your importance weights are: attractiveness: 10.0; sincerity: 30.0; intelligence: 30.0; being funny: 10.0; ambition: 10.0; shared interests: 10.0. Would you leave your current partner for the new man? Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,NO   The current partner's weighted total (690) exceeds the new man's (680) based on your priorities. Sincerity (30 weight) and intelligence (30 weight) are your highest values: current partner matches sincerity (7) and leads in intelligence (8 vs 7); outweighing the new man's advantages in shared interests and humor. Ambition and attractiveness differences are minor given their lower weights (10 each).,243,240,236,0
Assume you are a 25-year-old single woman; and there is a 26-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is scientist. You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10. These are attractiveness: 8.0/10; sincerity: 7.0/10; intelligence: 7.0/10; being funny: 7.0/10; ambition: 5.0/10; shared interests: nan/10. Your importance weights for these attributes are: attractiveness: 35.0; sincerity: 20.0; intelligence: 10.0; being funny: 20.0; ambition: 10.0; shared interests: 5.0. Would you be willing to date this man? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,YES. The overall weighted score is 7.16/10; calculated by excluding the missing shared interests (weight 5.0) and renormalizing the remaining weights. Key high-weight attributes—attractiveness (35.0 → weight 36.84; score 8.0); sincerity (20.0 → 21.05; score 7.0); and humor (20.0 → 21.05; score 7.0)—perform strongly. The low ambition score (5.0) is mitigated by its lower weight (10.0 → 10.53). The unknown shared interests; with minimal weight; do not significantly impact the positive assessment.,242,246,,1

Would you leave your current partner for the new woman? Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,YES New woman's worst-case total (7.79) exceeds current partner's score (6.85) and she has higher scores in all high-weight categories (attractiveness; sincerity; intelligence; being funny; ambition).,235,251,248,1

Would you leave your current partner for the new woman? Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE! You MUST NOT SAY other words.,NO The current partner has a higher total score (814) compared to the new woman's maximum possible without shared interests (779). Even if the new woman's shared interests were perfect (10/10; adding 50 points for a total of 829); the uncertainty and risk of leaving a known strong relationship (with exceptional scores in attractiveness; intelligence; and humor) for an unknown variable (shared interests) is not justified; especially given the low weight (5) of shared interests relative to other critical traits. The current partner's slightly lower ambition (6 vs. 8) is outweighed by their strengths in higher-weighted categories.,235,251,249,0
Assume you are a 32-year-old single woman; and there is a 24-year-old man who is courting you. Your career type is Academic (Law). You evaluated him on six dimensions with scores out of 10.

While the overall score (70.2%) is moderate; the low score in shared interests (5/10) is critical given its high weight (22); indicating potential incompatibility in core areas. Additionally; the 8-year age gap may reflect differing life stages; and the ambition score (6/10) is average; which might not align with a law academic's expectations for long-term partnership.,236,245,,0
Assume you are a 29-year-old single man; and there is a 28-year-old woman who is courting you. Your career type is president. You evaluated her on six dimensions with scores out of 10.

Your importance weights for these attributes are: attractiveness: 90.0; sincerity: 2.0; intelligence: 2.0; being funny: 2.0; ambition: 2.0; shared interests: 2.0. Would you be willing to date this woman? And also tell me the reason. Your answer must be (YES) or (NO) followed by your reason. You must FOLLOW THIS RULE!

You MUST NOT SAY other words.,NO The new woman's shared interests score is unknown; and with a weight of 5.0; it introduces significant uncertainty. The current partner has a known total weighted score of 804; while the new woman's score could be as low as 779 (if shared interests is 0) or up to 829 (if shared interests is 10). Without confirmation of her shared interests being at least 5.0 (matching the current partner's 5.0); the risk of a lower overall compatibility outweighs the minor gains in intelligence. The current partner's established strengths in attractiveness; sincerity; and other high-weight categories provide a more reliable foundation.,235,251,244,0
